Next Steps: Making It All Run (The "Deployment" Plan)
The code is perfect. Now, let's get it all running together. You have three main components that need to work in harmony:
The WPPConnect Server (likely in Docker)
Your FastAPI Backend
The SQLite Database
Here is your step-by-step plan to bring your application to life.
Step 1: Prepare Your Python Environment
Create requirements.txt: In your project root (C:\projects\MessagingAgent), create a file named requirements.txt and add the dependencies:
code
Code
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
sqlalchemy
pydantic
python-dotenv
google-generativeai
requests
Create a Virtual Environment & Install:
code
Bash
# From your project root
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Run the WPPConnect Server
Your Python code is an API client. It needs to talk to the WPPConnect server. The easiest way to run this is using Docker.
Install Docker Desktop on your Windows PC if you haven't already.
Run the Server: Open a new terminal and run this command. This will start the WPPConnect server, expose its API on port 21465, and automatically configure it with your secret key.
code
Bash
docker run --rm -it --name wppconnect-server -p 21465:21465 \
  -e "SECRET_KEY=THISISMYSECURETOKEN" \
  -e "SESSION_NAME=NERDWHATS_AMERICA" \
  wppconnect/server
Scan the QR Code: The terminal will show a QR code. Scan this with the phone you want to use for the bot. Once scanned, the server is live and connected.
Step 3: Run Your FastAPI Backend
With the WPPConnect server running in its own terminal, open another terminal for your backend.
Activate Virtual Environment:
code
Bash
# Make sure you are in C:\projects\MessagingAgent
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Start the Server: The create_all command in main.py will automatically create your messaging.db file.
code
Bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
You should see a confirmation that the server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000.
Step 4: Connect the Webhook
Now, you need to tell the WPPConnect server (in Docker) to send all new messages to your FastAPI backend.
Start a Webhook: You'll need to send a POST request to the WPPConnect server. You can use a tool like Postman, or simply another Python script to do this. The webhook URL must point to your FastAPI server's endpoint.
code
Code
POST http://localhost:21465/api/NERDWHATS_AMERICA/start-webhook

Body (JSON):
{
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/webhook/whatsapp",
  "events": ["onmessage"]
}
(Note: For a real server, you would use a tool like ngrok to expose your localhost to the internet, but since both are on the same machine, localhost might work).
Step 5: End-to-End Test
Send a WhatsApp message to the number connected to the bot.
Watch your FastAPI terminal: You should see the logs for /webhook/whatsapp being hit.
You'll see the logs from the controller, the AI service, and the WhatsApp service.
You will receive the AI-generated reply on your phone.
